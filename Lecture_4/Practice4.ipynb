    "1. We have data `MotherData.csv` excerpted from a recent Demographic and Health Survey.  First convert the dataset from `wide` (each observation is a mother) to `long` (each observation is a birth, with associated mother id). The id `caseid` identifies uniquely all the mothers.  These columns refer to variable of children **['bidx', 'bord', 'b0', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b10', 'b11', 'b12', 'b13', 'b15', 'b16']** and have new columns for all their children. We have information for 20 children. It starts from last child to oldest one. Use for loops to reshape this dataset from `wide` to `long` ate mother and children level. If you want to get more information from the columns please see [this pdf](http://www.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG4/Recode6_DHS_22March2013_DHSG4.pdf)."
