### 1. Daniela Santander (danisantanderalva@hotmail.com:Strangers in the night

      Strangers in the night exchanging glances
      Wondering in the night
      What were the chances we'd be sharing love
      Before the night was through
      Something in your eyes was so inviting
      Something in your smile was so exciting
      Something in my heart
      Told me I must have you
      Strangers in the night
      Two lonely people we were strangers in the night
      Up to the moment
      When we said our first hello
      Little did we know
      Love was just a glance away
      A warm embracing dance away, and
      Ever since that night we've been together
      Lovers at first sight, in love forever
      It turned out so right
      For strangers in the night
      Love was just a glance away
      A warm embracing dance away
      Ever since that night we've been together
      Lovers at first sight, in love forever
      It turned out so right
      For strangers in the night
### 2. Emmanuel Diaz (emmanueldigo@gmail.com): Somewhere only we know

      I walked across an empty land
      I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
      I felt the earth beneath my feet
      Sat by the river, and it made me complete
      
      Oh, simple thing
      Where have you gone?
      I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
      So tell me when you're gonna let me in
      I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
      
      I came across a fallen tree
      I felt the branches of it looking at me
      Is this the place we used to love?
      Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
      
      Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
      I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
      So tell me when you're gonna let me in
      I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
      
      And if you have a minute, why don't we go
      Talk about it somewhere only we know?
      This could be the end of everything
      So why don't we go
      Somewhere only we know?
      Somewhere only we know
      
      Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
      I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
      So tell me when you're gonna let me in
      I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
      
      And if you have a minute, why don't we go
      Talk about it somewhere only we know?
      This could be the end of everything
      So why don't we go?
      So why don't we go?
      
      This could be the end of everything
      So why don't we go
      Somewhere only we know?
      Somewhere only we know
      Somewhere only we know
