Daniela: Strawberry Moon - Twice
Yanell: Stop crying your heart out - Oasis
Osman: I've Been Dazed - Michael Kiwanuka
I've been dazed
My pride is gone
My mistake
Guess I'll move on
London days
It's cold outside
Lost my way
You know I've tried
Won't you carry on?
Won't you carry on?
Help me carry on
Won't you carry on?
The Lord said to me (The Lord said to me)
Time is a healer (Time is a healer)
Love is the answer (Love is the answer)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
The Lord said to me (The Lord said to me)
Time is a healer (Time is a healer)
Truth is the answer (Truth is the answer)
I'm on the way (I'm on the way)
Lost my way
You know I've tried
The Lord said to me
Help me carry on
Won't you carry on? (The Lord said to me, the Lord said to me)

Fernando: Iris - Goo Goo Dolls
