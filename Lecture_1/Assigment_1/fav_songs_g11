Alvaro Zapata
Freezin'
Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
Oh, feelin'
Maybe he'll see a little betters, any days
Oh, hand out
Faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar
Oh, dark grin
He can't help, when he's happy, he looks insane
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again
Kneelin'
Lookin' through the paper though he doesn't know to read
Oh, prayin'
Now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin'
Understands the weather of the winter's on its way
Oh, ceilings
Few and far between all the legal halls of shame
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah, ooh, ah yeah, fuck it up
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Ah, someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away
