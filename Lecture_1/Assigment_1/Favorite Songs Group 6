1. Milagros Meza - Dance with somebody

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'till now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take the chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take the chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ooh ooh (dance)
Come on baby (dance)
Ooh, yeah (dance)
Now get with this
Whoah!
Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby?
Don'tcha wanna dance with me boy?
Hey don'tcha wanna dance with me baby?
With somebody who loves me?


2. Kerly Tito

In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
My God, that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining

We may as well go home?
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do?
The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
All about God and his mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did he desert me?

In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally
